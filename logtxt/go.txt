Great question! 🚀 Running Go in a **serverless environment on Vercel** is straightforward, but it requires following Vercel’s conventions for Go functions. Let me break it down:

---

## 📦 Project Structure
Vercel expects your Go serverless functions to live inside the **`/api`** directory.

Example:
```
my-vercel-app/
 ├── api/
 │    └── hello.go
 ├── vercel.json   (optional config)
 └── ...
```

---

## 📝 Go Serverless Function
Your code snippet is almost correct, but Vercel requires the function to be named **`Handler`** and to use the `net/http` signature:

```go
package handler

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

// This is the entry point for Vercel
func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go!</h1>")
}
```

- **Package name** must be `handler`.
- **Function name** must be `Handler`.
- Vercel automatically compiles and deploys this as a serverless function.

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps
1. **Install Vercel CLI**  
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```
2. **Deploy your project**  
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
3. Visit:  
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/hello
   ```
   You’ll see:  
   ```
   <h1>Hello from Go!</h1>
   ```

---

## 🔑 Key Notes
- Each `.go` file inside `/api` becomes its own endpoint.  
  - `api/hello.go` → `/api/hello`  
  - `api/books.go` → `/api/books`  
- You can use any Go libraries, but keep in mind **serverless functions are stateless**.  
- For databases, connect to external services (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) using environment variables.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to extend this into a **CRUD API in Vercel with Go** (e.g., `/api/books` with Create, Read, Update, Delete)? That way you’ll have a full serverless backend example.
