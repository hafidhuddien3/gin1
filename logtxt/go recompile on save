How to get recompile-on-save
Use the live-reload Gin utility:

Install: go install github.com/codegangsta/gin@latest
Run: gin (or gin run), which will watch your Go files, rebuild, and restart on changes.

Alternative watchers (if you prefer):
Tools like CompileDaemon, air, reflex, fresh, or modd provide similar watch-and-restart workflows; they exist to solve the same “auto-recompile and reload on file change” need.
